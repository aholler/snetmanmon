A simple network manager and monitor for Linux

snetmanmon is a simple alternative to ifupdown, ifplugd, networkmanager,
connman and similiar tools, which all lacked some functionality I wanted.


In particular it makes it possible to not only react on (dis)appearing
interfaces, but also on (dis)appearing IPs.

Furthermore it's a tool to keep track (logging) of changes in regard
to interfaces and IP addresses on a machine. Something which becomes
more important in times of virtual machines, containers and
software-defined networking (SDN) and which isn't supported by the
tools above.

That means if you want to log the (dis)appearance of interfaces and
IP addresses on your machine, this tool might be your choice.

But it also gives the possibility to do almost anything else if
a network interface or an IP (dis)appears. E.g. if you want to
start a DHCP-client if a WLAN dongle with a MAC a:b:c:d:e:f will be
attached to your system and furthermore you want to start a
NTP-client only if the IP i.j.k.m (or i::*) appears on interface
ethN, this is easy possible to do with snetmanmon too.

Why is it called simple? Because it almost doesn't do any actions
itself. E.g. It doesn't configure network interfaces nor does it
do DHCP by itself, but instead relies on whatever tool the users
prefers to accomplish such actions.


To build snetmanmon, call

	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
	make

Afterwards you just can call it with

	./snetmanmon snetmanmon.conf.simple_example

to test it (no special privileges are needed and nothing else will
be executed).


If you're missing features or want support, please keep in mind that
the author built snetmanmon only to fulfill his own needs and that
he doesn't care much for anything else if it isn't payed.


PS: If you're working for Google or if you are a Google employee,
and you want to use this tool, please give the autor a call so that
he can make a quiz (have some fun) *with you* in order to test if
you qualify as an user.
The idea was actually to add this as an exception to the license, but
unfortunately that would disqualify the license in regard to some
rules for open source licenses.
